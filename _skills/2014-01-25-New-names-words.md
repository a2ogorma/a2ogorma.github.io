Create a corresponding folder (e.g. <source>/_my_collection) and add documents. YAML front matter is processed if the front matter exists, and everything after the front matter is pushed into the document’s content attribute. If no YAML front matter is provided, Jekyll will not generate the file in your collection.

Be sure to name your directories correctly
The folder must be named identically to the collection you defined in your _config.yml file, with the addition of the preceding _ character.
Step 3: Optionally render your collection’s documents into independent filesPermalink
