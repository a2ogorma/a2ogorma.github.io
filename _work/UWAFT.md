## Summary
-----
* **Developed optimization strategies by modeling** various vehicle components using a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) real-time processing system.
* **Reduced energy usage** of individual component systems through efficiency-based control development.
* Created a **method to extract key performance metrics** from a custom vehicle simulation system.
* Member of the Controls, Systems Modeling and Simulations team, HIL Subteam Lead.

## Tools used
-----
* MATLAB
* Simulink
* Excel
* dSPACE HIL System
* Vector
* MicroAutoBox Hybrid Supervisory Controller

## Notes
-----
As the HIL Subteam Lead, **project management** fundamentals were used, from onboarding new members to efficiently allocating tasks to members to meet broader team objectives.
